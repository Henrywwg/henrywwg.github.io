        <h2 >Featured Projects</h2>
        <p>This is a little showcase of some of my more recent and/or interesting projects. It's a good mix of personal and school or work projects so 
            if you're interested in computer architecture, cosplay and hobbyist computing projects or materials science (strange mix I know) then have a look around!</p>

                        <b>RISC Processor</b><br>
                        An in order five-stage pipelined single core WISC-F24 based processor. 
                        This neat little project involved iteratively developing the processor starting from a single cycle design, then working up to pipelining. 
                        We also designed and wrote in a cache to represent more realistic imperfect memory. (The picture is not a mistake)

                        <b>Protogen HUD</b><br>
                        This one's part of a 'cosplay' so it's a personal favorite. A whole slew of parts including microcontrollers, mini-computers 
                        (Rasp. Pi) and lots of discrete electronics has made this an increasingly involved endeavor. Also had some fun playing with stereo cameras and displays for the HUD. 
                        I'm hoping to get off Arduino MCUs and switch over to a Cortex board soon.

                        <b>FPGA Logic Analyzer</b><br>
                        This one was a doozy. 400MHz 5 channel digital logic analyzer with capture and storage abilities.
                        Wrote and tested a dozen or so modules ranging from SPI and UART to a proprietary processor to manage data acquisition and communication.
                        Pictured on the left is but a modicum of the horror that was writing testbenches and fixing bugs for this project.

                <p>This was a course project for ECE552 that I worked on over the course of a semester. The goal with the project was to design and implement a pipelined SISD RISC process based on documentation for an ISA. We did this with the F24-WISC ISA which, if you can’t tell based on the name, is an academic ISA just for the semester I was in the course. It’s loosely based on MIPS but some instructions were cut out for simplicity. 

                    There were four main benchmarks for this project:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Single cycle processor</li>
                            <li>Pipelining</li>
                            <li>Cache for imperfect several cycle memory</li>
                            <li>Pipelining + Cache</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

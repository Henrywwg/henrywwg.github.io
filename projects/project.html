                        <b>RISC Processor</b><br>
                        An in order five-stage pipelined single core WISC-F24 based processor. 
                        This neat little project involved iteratively developing the processor starting from a single cycle design, then working up to pipelining. 
                        We also designed and wrote in a cache to represent more realistic imperfect memory.

                        <b>Protogen HUD</b><br>
                        This one's part of a 'cosplay' so it's a personal favorite. A whole slew of parts including microcontrollers, mini-computers 
                        (Rasp. Pi) and lots of discrete electronics has made this an increasingly involved endeavor. Also had some fun playing with stereo cameras and displays for the HUD. 
                        I'm hoping to get off Arduino MCUs and switch over to a Cortex board soon.
